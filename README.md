# Social Network API
## Description
- I was motivated by my desire to complete a backend project from scratch.
- I built this project to better understand the relationship between the Model and the Controller in the MVC paradigm. 
- This project allows users to post thoughts and reactions to those thoughts. Users will also have the ability to add and remove friends.
- With this project I learned how to create a NoSql database and express routes to create the Model and Controller of the MVC paradigm from scratch. 
- Challenges: I had trouble creating the reaction post routes as it was sending as a string and not an object. After carefully reviewing the code I found the problem to be a missing imported method.
